# URLs of custom emojis that will be uploaded by the bot upon joining a server. 
# Server ID is stored in processed_servers.json so the bot knows what servers it has already uplaoded to.
# Non Nitro servers have a limit of 50 custom emoji uploads but the bot can store 2,000.
# Use /force_emoji_upload in Discord to force a reupload.

# valid URL example:
# happy_face|https://example.com/happy.png
